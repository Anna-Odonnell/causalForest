Stefan Wager and Susan Athey. <b>Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests.</b> 2015. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04342.pdf">arxiv</a>]

For an actively maintained version of the present software, with a focus on causal trees, see https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree. A more scalable version of causal forests, built in C++, is under development.

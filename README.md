# DEPRECATED causalForest
This repository is preserved for archival purposes only, and is not under active maintenance. It has replication scripts for experiments from:

Stefan Wager and Susan Athey. <b>Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Forests.</b> 2015. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04342.pdf">arxiv</a>]

For anyone wanting to use causal forests, please see the ```causal.forest()``` function in https://github.com/swager/grf. This function is more efficiently implemented, has multi-core support, and also appears to have better statistical performance.
